    "## Assignment A\n",
    "This queue is a (M/M/2) queue, since the arrivals and service is memoryless and there are two cups of coffee that can be made. We have that we have a FCFS order (since the person waiting the longest can make their order). We can assume an infite waiting room. The model is Ergotic, since every state can be reached from any other state and it is aperiodic. We have the following variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability of waiting for service\n",
    "$$ \\lambda=30, \\mu=20, \\rho=1\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\rho}{c}=\\frac{3}{4}<1$$\n",
    "To calculate the long-run fraction of costumers who have to wait, we used the Erlang-C formula. With this formula we can calculate the probability $P_{\\text{delay}}$:\n",
    "$$ C(c,\\rho) = \\frac{\\rho^c/ c!}{(1 - \\rho / c) \\sum_{n=0}^{c - 1} \\rho^n/n! + \\rho^c/c!} = \\frac{\\frac{(1\\frac{1}{2})^2}{2}}{(1-\\frac{3}{4})(1+1\\frac{1}{2})+ \\frac{1\\frac{1}{2}^2}{2}} = \\frac{9}{14}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Average total waiting time\n",
    "The long-run average time it takes for a costumer to get his/her coffee we calculated using the formula for expected total waiting time. We know that we can $W_s = W_q + E[\\text{service time}]$. We have that $W_q = L_q / \\lambda_{\\text{eff}}$, where $\\lambda_{\\text{eff}} = \\sum \\lambda p_n = \\lambda$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate $L_q$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L_q = \\frac{\\rho ^ {c+1}}{(c - 1)!(c-\\rho)^2} p_0 = \\frac{27}{14} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus then we get $ W_q = \\frac{9}{140} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W_s = W_q + \\frac{1}{\\mu} = \\frac{4}{35} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Employee utilization rate\n",
    "The long-run fraction of time per hour that a employee is busy we calculated with the utilization rate. We know $\\bar{c} = L_s - L_q$.\n",
    "$$U= \\frac{\\bar{c}}{c}= \\frac{\\rho}{c}=\\frac{3}{4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment B\n",
    "We are asked to calculate the total costs, and then divide by the expected number of coffees per year. We already have $ p_0 = \\frac{1}{7} $, $p_1=\\frac{1\\frac{1}{2}}{1}*\\frac{1}{7}=\\frac{3}{14}$, $p_2=1-\\frac{7}{14}-\\frac{3}{14}=\\frac{9}{14}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total labor costs are:\n",
    "$$ \\text{total labor cost} = 300 * 9 * 25 * 2=135000$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we calculated the power consumption costs with this formula: \n",
    "$$\\text{power consumption} = p_0 * \\text{total days} * \\text{power usage} + p_1 * \\text{total days} * \\text{power usage} + p_2 * \\text{total days} * \\text{power usage}  \\\\=  \\frac{1}{7}*2700*0,3+\\frac{3}{14}*2700*0,8+\\frac{9}{14}*2700*1,2 = 665,36$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The total costs are: \n",
    "$$ \\text{total costs} = \\text{total labor} + \\text{maintentance} + \\text{power consumption} = 135000+200+665,36=135865,36$$\n",
    "The average number of busy machines is $1\\frac{1}{2}$ and it takes 3 minutes, so $\\frac{1}{20}$ hour, to serve a costumer.\n",
    "Then there are $\\frac{2700}{\\frac{1}{20}*1\\frac{1}{2}}=36000$ cups sold\n",
    "The price of a coffee is at least $\\frac{135865,36}{36000}=3,77$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment C\n",
    "We see this problem as a M/M/1 queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stable Queue\n",
    "A stable queue is when $\\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu}<1$ This is when $\\frac{30}{x}<1$ Thus when x is larger than 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected yearly costs\n",
    "We can calculate $p_0$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_0 = 1 - \\rho = 1 - \\lambda / x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $p_1$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p_1 = (1 - \\rho)\\rho = (1 - \\lambda / x)\\frac{\\lambda}{x} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we get the following yearly costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{yearly cost} = \\text{hourly salary} * \\text{total hours} + \\text{yearly maintanence} * x \n",
    "+ p_0 * \\text{idle energy usage (in kW)} +\\\\\n",
    " (1 - p_0) * \\text{active energy usage (in kW)} * x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feasible solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "We want the sum of the yearly costs and purchase price below the previous yearly costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{new yearly costs} + \\text{purchase price} < \\text{previous yearly costs}\\\\\n",
    "\\text{new yearly costs + 200x < \\text{previous yearly costs}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And we also want the waiting time to be equal or lower:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ W_q = \\frac{\\lambda/x}{x - \\lambda} \\leq \\frac{9}{140}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute the feasible solution "
